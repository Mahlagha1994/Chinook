# Chinook Data Analysis Project

The Chinook data model simulates a digital media store, featuring tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. The media-related data was derived from an Apple iTunes library.

**Objective:**  
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Chinook database to address key business questions and gain insights into sales trends.

**Approach:**

- **Data Extraction and Analysis:** Developed SQL queries to extract data related to sales, customer behavior, and product performance from the Chinook database.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted EDA and statistical analysis to uncover key features, patterns, and trends in sales and market dynamics.
- **Visualization and Reporting:** Created interactive dashboards using Power BI with DAX formulas and Matplotlib, enabling real-time data connectivity and effective presentation of insights.
- 
**Tools:**  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), Power BI
